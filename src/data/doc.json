Let‚Äôs dig into the story of one of these artifacts: <span class=bolded>The Lenna image</span>."},{"text":"The Lenna image may be relatively unknown in pop culture today, but in the engineering world, it remains an icon. I first encountered the image in an undergrad class, then grad school, and then all over the sites and software I use every day as a tech worker like <a href=https://github.com/mikolalysenko/lena>Github</a>, <a href=https://docs.opencv.org/4.5.3/dc/dd3/tutorial_gausian_median_blur_bilateral_filter.html>OpenCV</a>, <a href=https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56346850/set-image-inside-png-transparency>Stack Overflow</a>, and <a href=https://www.quora.com/topic/Image-Processing>Quora</a>."},{"text":"<span class=bolded>This is Lenna.</span>"},{"text":"To understand where the image is today, you have to understand how it got here. So, I decided to scrape Google scholar, search, and reverse image search results to track down thousands of instances of the image across the internet (see more in the <a href=#methods>methods section</a>)."},{"text":"Lena Fors√©n, the real human behind the Lenna image, was <a href=https://www.iplayboy.com/issue/19721101>first published in Playboy</a> in <span>1972</span>. Soon after, USC engineers searching for a suitable test image for their image processing research sought inspiration from the magazine. They deemed Lenna the right fit and scanned the image into digital, <a href=https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/rgb>RGB</a> existence.","image":"playboy"},{"text":"From here, the story of the image follows the story of the internet. Lenna was one of the first inhabitants of ARPANet, the internet‚Äôs predecessor, and then the world wide web."},{"text":"While the image‚Äôs reach was limited to a few research papers in the ‚Äô70s and ‚Äô80s, in <span>1991</span>, Lenna was featured on the cover of an <a href=https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/optical-engineering/volume-30/issue-07>engineering journal</a> alongside another popular test image, <a href=https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Original-standard-test-image-of-Peppers_fig8_259521525>Peppers</a>.","image":"journal"},{"text":"This caught the attention of Playboy, which threatened a copyright infringement lawsuit. Engineers who had grown attached to Lenna fought back. Ultimately, they prevailed, and as a Playboy VP <a href=https://www.wired.com/1997/05/playmate-meets-geeks-who-made-her-a-net-star/>reflected on the drama</a>: \"We decided we should exploit this because it is a phenomenon.\""},{"text":"The Playboy controversy canonized Lenna in engineering folklore and prompted an explosion of conversation about the image.

It‚Äôs time I retired from tech, too. We can make a simple change today that creates a lasting change for tomorrow. Let‚Äôs commit to losing me.‚Äù","image":"losing-lena"},{"text":"After the film‚Äôs release, many of my female colleagues shared stories about their own encounters with the image throughout their careers. When one of the only women this well referenced, respected, and remembered in your field is known for a nude photo that was taken of her and is now used without her consent, it inevitably shapes the perception of the position of women in tech and the value of our contributions."},{"text":"The film called on the engineering community to stop their spread of the image and use alternatives instead. This led to efforts to remove the image from textbooks and production code and a slow, but noticeable decline in the image‚Äôs use for research."},{"text":"But despite this progress, almost 2 years later, the use of Lenna continues.

For the two text-based search engines (Google scholar and search), I used combinations of keywords, variations on \"lenna+jpg\"+OR+\"lenna+jpeg\" or ‚Äúlenna+computer+vision‚Äù to scrape hits that matched those queries. For Google scholar, I used different time intervals from 1970-2021, usually in 5 year chunks, to pull data. For Google search, I performed a manual check on the results, to filter out irrelevant pages from the dataset. In order to identify variations of the Lenna image, I used four different base images for the Google Reverse image search: the standard image, wider cropped image, grayscale image, and a flipped grayscale image. In all cases I only pulled data up to the first 100 pages of results.
